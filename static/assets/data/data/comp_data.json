Is it kind of like a structural thing you do? Yeah, that's really just a question.",

And we think  you know for it to be more interesting it would be much more interesting if that widened out beyond us into whole other sets of people doing whole other sets of things and while we really like that to happen the thing is everyone's really busy in the world you know this pressure like rent people can't afford to live for their work all this sort of stuff so uh  While people are always like, this is great, we'd really love to get involved, the practicalities are quite difficult. And we also haven't always been graded because we are ourselves quite busy. And we tried to institute the structure where we'd meet once a week, or sorry, we'd meet the following week after an event. And especially recently, we've just been kind of up the walls. And so we haven't always managed to do that. And when you  I've been involved in a number of organizations, and I think it's really important to have quite clear structures because it allows people to get involved. And as we said at the start, we don't really have them because we haven't quite. So it's kind of on us to maybe also find ways to make it more open to other people to get involved. But that also is a big job, and it takes a lot of labor to set up those systems. And also, the risk, because you don't know if you do them, but anyone wants to be involved anyway. So it's a funny one. I don't know.",

It's like, you don't have the one person actually engaging and caring about what you do. And I think that's the really nice thing to see. Like, you know, community is really the most important thing. And I think it seems to be quite at the heart of it as well.  I might throw in another question here, because it might be a little bit related to what you've just said as well. How have you found, if at all, that the landscape of digital art and technology have changed over, I would say, over the course of data? But I mean, like, you know, maybe everyone's obviously got a different time frame here. But if you have noticed a difference, and especially these people coming back and in, like, what would you kind of feel that has changed most, really?  I can throw it over to Tom and Ash.",

But it's really at a kind of a input output level. You know, I know that's in the nature of AI a little bit, but it's a bit of a black box and it's much harder. A lot of technologies nowadays, well, they're not really based so much around, say, algorithms, they're much more based on things like data. And that's not something, if you open source it, that you can actually reproduce. So as an artist, you can't necessarily reproduce a training set.  So I think there, I think there's something in technology over the last 20 years that specifically, I guess, with kind of technology in terms of like digital code-based technology, it's where they've become a bit less accessible. And I think that's also led to like, I think a lot about social media, which social media art, there was a certain amount of it, maybe kind of, you know, 10 years ago might've been at the peak of it or a little bit more recently than that.  And now I teach in a college and very few of my students make work by social media, even though it's probably one of the biggest shaping forces in their life. And I think that's really kind of interesting that it's become almost invisible in a way.",

And I don't, and I also don't mean this as a criticism of the students. It's more about the technology and it's, it's kind of disappearance, you know? And I think, I mean, maybe, you know, because people talk about infrastructure that, um,  so an infrastructure is only something you know notice when it breaks and maybe things like social media have become infrastructural so that we don't see them anymore but I also think that that's a really interesting thing about technology and it really makes me dangerous. I know Paul will probably come on in just a minute because  there's a whole pile of artwork that's actually, its focus is making infrastructure visible because actually it's a really shaping force in our lives and whether that's like Paul's working on infrastructures, but obviously there's, you know, whole histories of like in STS and stuff like that, looking at the unequal provision of services and services shape our possibilities and so on. So I don't know, that's one thing I think for sure that's happened. I also think as technology has really like  up in terms of its capacity there became of course a focus on things like what you might call like finish so everything's like 4k now 8k you know and we're hopefully doing an event actually with this festival in canada and ireland called the small file media festival that kind of questions that idea of like more more more and i think that's something that's also  it used to be the case that people were really like, you could only make a video that was like this many pixels. So you always went to as big as you could be, but now the technology is so capable, but also we've realized the kind of environmental cost of that are, I mean, other material costs of that. So people are beginning to say, oh yeah, maybe this kind of limitless horizon idea is no longer valid.",

And as kind of Tom alluded to, you know, there was a lot more kind of  a lot more good vibes about technology, you know, but we've had like, to be real, like we've had Edward Snowden's revelations, although not too much has changed and so on. So the honeymoon period has worn off. You can even see that, like in relation to Ireland over the last few years, you know, you kind of have this dominant Silicon Docks narrative. Now there's kind of greater kind of criticality, more accessible to the public. We're seeing it specifically in language, like around data centers.  Obviously, corporate tax rate, you know, we had it with Apple and so on and so forth, and it's changing and they're just hot off the presses. And on the subject of infrastructure, I was down in Grand Canal Dock last night with a group and Meta have actually, they've gone.  Weird, they're not in offices anymore. They've gone somewhere else, like, but they're no longer in Grand Canal Dock. So, you know, shit's changed. Excuse my language, but language is all right. Things are changing. And obviously, you know, artwork is changing to reflect that, I would guess. Maybe Tom and Ashley, I'm not, I'm in academia, but not really kind of student focused so much at the moment. Although, you know, obviously, you know, we saw the last,  event like Aoife's work, you know, on social media, on Twitter and so on. So, yeah, sorry, I'm kind of rambling on here. Yeah, perfect.",

One thing I did when I was looking at that question, and this is maybe not someone's data, I think it's just like, oh, my own little wish list.  I'd love to see, like I have a dream that there will be like a physical place, studio, gallery for this kind of work, an independent one.  don't need a shitload of funding from pick your big tech company want to get in on the action something small so you know i'm not talking about dublin it could be limerick it could be mayo i don't care it would just be great to see it happen somewhere for people to go but somewhere for people internationally to go  like the agencies and stuff. So I think you, there's another, and I'm going to, sorry, I'm going off on one here. I know there was another question about inspiration and other organizations. So looking, and obviously there's, as I said at the beginning, there's lots of brilliant stuff going on here as well. Oh shit. Has everyone just turned their camera off?  No, we're all still here, don't worry. I was like, oh man, they don't like what I'm saying. Like, there's places like Fergus Field in London, there's like N\u00eemes in Cyprus and Limassol, obviously bigger, kind of slightly bigger ones like Transmedia, like, well, that's a festival as such, but, you know, like the influencers in Barcelona, like, I think that's kind of dormant now. Like, there's all of these other great spaces.  and events in Europe that are very much, you know, kind of community orientated, if I could say that. So we have that, you have that, not just somewhere data, but you guys think that everyone else is doing really great stuff, but it would be just nice to have a  Hey, that's, oh, I'm coming up to here. Well, okay. Obviously we're all going to go and meet here and, you know, be nice. Hey, look, I'm pitching to the choir, maybe here, a gallery studio space for people working in media, digital media, arts, et cetera, et cetera.",

And so we're talking about like technologies to help to maintain or like produce like infrastructural technologies to help to produce some sort of community.

So, yeah, that's, I mean, there might be another group presenting as well, but we tend to try and keep things quite balanced. In fact, we tend to try and balance things in the opposite direction.

But yeah, I mean from us, concept novel was kind of a limerick thing. So I guess through that we were kind of, yeah, bound through that. Oh, Ash is here. Woo! Maybe this is a silly question and I should know the answer already because I've been here a bit more, but are you all artists? Mostly artists, trying to be. Attempting it anyway, like, you know, giving it his best shot. Yeah, great. Yeah, I think this is one of the, this is actually one of the problems, um,  with the, this is kind of one of the reasons we did the Constant Metal Newsletter, because we had such an annoyance with not really sometimes knowing ourselves what we were, like, and having this problem of, like, you know, definition, and especially externally as well, towards sometimes other people. I've been, like, like, even a project I was doing there, I was, like, working with Fidgetfee in, like, an aerial dance center, and they brought me in, and they're, like, literally the first I joined the meeting, and they were all dancers and aerialists, and they're, and then, like, they're, like, oh, we have,  Ger here, our lighting designer, is going to help us with the lights. And we have Walter. And Walter does, what do you do, Walter? And I was like, I don't know. Lazy. Depends on who's asking. It depends on what you want from me. So after two weeks of R&D, we still didn't know what I really did. But I did something, so it was fine. I don't know if that's the imposter syndrome sometimes coming through.

It'd probably be like, I don't know, we haven't figured out yet, might be part of the news editor, might be its own publishing thing, if it's very long and has lots of interesting points, because I don't want to cut out too much as well. Because yeah, honestly, like we, like just a little bit backstory of also like,  We started this newsletter thing. Constable L has been kind of doing its own thing for a while. Between me, Scott, and Roisin, we've been just trying to do new media, audiovisual events. They were quite hard to do, so they were quite spaced out in time. And after the last one, it was just such a big endeavor that we were like, we're going to pack this for a good long while, because we just need to get some space.  It was amazing, it was great fun, but like just the logistic hurdles of like being both the curator and the technical manager and the events provider and space provider and all that stuff, it was just crazy. So we practiced for a while and then me and Kayleigh got talking  I don't actually know what we're talking about. I think we were just kind of having a Zoom chat, and we were talking about basically that Denise McDonough from Culture Works, who was basically doing some stuff for the Arts Council, helping them devise the digital strategy. I don't know if you guys have seen that thing, but the digital strategy came out. This was like before, it was while it was still in kind of its last process of being worked on.  and we were kind of at that time getting quite frustrated with the discipline side of things where we didn't really quite know how to label us and also like we felt like that in the Arts Council process it's hard to kind of say oh I'm a visual artist well that's not quite descriptive of what you're actually doing so  Big old grievances there, we've written about it anyway. But basically, we were kind of thinking like, I was saying this to Kayleen that we had thought about like, you know, how to remedy this. One of the things was a newsletter. And then we were kind of thinking like, well, maybe there's someone in Ireland that has done this before. And then Kayleen had mentioned you guys dated. I was like, I actually had never heard of you, which I felt like a really bad disgrace because you guys have been around for so long.  I was like, yeah, we tried to suss out, do you guys cover this newsletter side? We didn't really have a newsletter, so that's why we went off and did this. But that's the start of seeing your stuff. And I was like, fuck, this is really odd. I feel bad for not having known this sooner. So that's why I was like, you know what? Maybe a chat and getting to meet you guys was the best way to do this.",

One thing that I think is worth saying at the start, because I did look at the questions a little bit, or a few of them, is, and you used the word, like, collective a lot, you know, which would be kind of a reasonable. I did not praise that one, yeah. But I suppose it's worth saying that, like, data is, it's just, it's been a lot of things over the years, and it's kind of really a very loose association of people who have an interest in art about, with technology.  And it's been running for over 20 years and different people at different times have done kind of more or less of the labor of that. So that like people like Jonah Booker-Cohen, Nikki Gogan, Ben Doolan, Rachel Dwyer, Tim Redfern. At the moment, Ashley and Paul and I are the people who kind of do most of that labor. Only, I suppose, just because it's kind of, you know, the hand is spinning and it's landing on us at the moment.  it is quite a loose thing and it's changed a lot in its form. And so we don't really have, I mean, to some extent, we don't really have codified ways of working. What we do have and what is collective is an interest in art about technology. And so we're quite, I wouldn't say it's totally ad hoc in the way we organize things at all. Like we, there's some consistency where we're doing them at the moment. Every month we have a structure, we have certain rules about trying to  I suppose, represent things in a certain way. But we really don't have a very organized and kind of set identity because we ultimately don't, well, I don't know, maybe this is where the other guys might come in on this, but we don't really want to be like the owners of data. We just happen to be the people at the moment who are booking the venues. And we constantly are  talking at events about like, well, who wants to propose a thing or who wants to do a thing? Sometimes people have no time for doing that. Other times they do and they suggest something or someone says, I'd like to present. And so we have people either coming to us saying, oh, I was at the data event or I heard about it. I'd like to do something. And equally, we spend our time sometimes thinking about it. But it is very fluid, I guess is worth saying.",

But really, most of the labor of data is people who are willing to talk about and share their work in public. And that's really important.

We facilitate that.  people come, they decide how they want to present their work, they decide, you know, really what they want to present, and we kind of hand that over to them. So actually, it's kind of incorrect of me to say that we're the labourers landing on us, because actually, that's not true. Fair.

And there was quite a crossover between people, artists in particular, and maybe people working with technology at a, at a, like making it level, you know, so it was a real crossover there. And you had people working in various kind of tech, like it was before even the term kind of tech was knocking around to the same extent. So there was a, I think there was a different social alliance there, you know,  And now I think we exist at a time which, you know, we have, I suppose, what is called big tech, maybe, you know, we've got a lot of platforms that shape a huge aspect of our life. They tend to be closed platforms. The role of a kind of media artist is very changed in that context. So in Dublin, for example, we have the headquarters of, you know, Google, Facebook, all these companies. We have a huge amount of the economy of Ireland is driven by these things, but we don't have a strong technology critical, um,  context, like a really strong one in the sense of like, for example, the universities, there's no, you know, like courses in like technology and society. There's no, you know, of course, there's lots of individual work and academics doing really great stuff. And so I'm not suggesting I'm an artist doing really great stuff around it.",

And I think because the project is so closed, it's harder for there to be a kind of a bedrock of people who are cracking it open. Certainly for me, one of the interests is trying to reproduce a community, not reproduce a particular community, but produce the context in which a community of technology-critical people can make work.  I think in the past, you know, there's been loads of really good work that was funded by tech companies. And that was because it was in a different context now. But at the moment, we're a little bit, we'd be wary, let's say, of that and of being kind of connected with that in some way. Certainly I would. I imagine the others as well.

Usually these spaces are, again, public and low cost barrier. So it should be free to go there or almost free to go there, very cheap.  And these spaces, he says, are like, or they kind of say, is basically a place where ideas of society can flow. A barrister might meet a worker, like, you know, or, you know, artists will talk to politicians. It's a place, and there's no, there is law, there's order, but there's no classes. So in these, in these spaces, people can talk freely and be, are open to criticism and be criticized. And there's no one there to basically censor anyone.  And I think this is something that kind of lacks in Ireland a little bit. I think the pub was the closest we ever get to a third space. And I think that's why pubs are so important in Ireland, because they have this, you know, yeah, the stratification of society, I guess, turns sideways a little bit at least. But I think that's something I definitely would love to see in Ireland, as you were saying, like having a space where big data companies and people who work in these data companies might be in contact with artists and academics and  a space where people can talk freely about these things without maybe criticism.",

People are chatting about actually very interesting, sometimes tech related, sometimes not, sometimes art related, sometimes not, but I find it's very interesting to kind of get people in a space and have people present ideas and new ways of thinking, but then to kind of  I think it's a very important part for the events to hold that space for a little while longer and allow the conversation to happen. Because I think for the speakers as well, because everything is done free and we don't get paid and we don't charge and the speakers don't get paid, it's important that they get  something out of it themselves. And I think that's why there's so much freedom in terms of like what they can present. It's always just like what is most helpful for them.

Just to kind of piggyback on that, just a question of support and obviously money and people aren't getting paid and kind of Tom touched on the context of labour.

What we're saying, though, is, you know, so this idea of like a third space or like a public sphere in which this kind of conversation can happen is, of course, this ideal that we would really love to have. But I think it actually touched on earlier on about us moving around the city. I think we're also aware that actually spaces aren't  neutral at all. And so the pub is a space for some people that they're quite happy to have a chat in. We had a couple of events in NCAD because they were provided with a space, which was great, but obviously an institution that a lot of people aren't comfortable with. And I mean, if you look at, say, the institution of technology and technology-based art, historically, it has a very, you know, like non-diverse bunch of people working in it. And the art as an institution itself is also like that. So quite aware of  I suppose one, the failings of art, our own failings of running data, not that it's on us specifically to address that on our own, but that, you know,  Like, it's very hard to have events. One, that someone will give you a space for free that has a projector, has a thing. It's very hard to find spaces that will reach beyond those kind of limitations. And arguably, there is no space that isn't limited in some way in terms of access to certain people or certain groups. And so I think it's really great. This third space idea is, I mean, it is a really great idea. And this idea of like a free public sphere is, I think, in the world at the moment, like a really important thing.  But it's something that unfortunately, I think we will never really get to either. I think it's more of an ideological thinking of like how you can think of how they thought of spaces, how you can divide up and categorize certain spaces kind of like, you know, when they're purposing. And I think there's a lot of conversation and books written about third space being online and how open forums and the new third space is realistically like, you know, so.  Even doing this, like, you know, this could be seen or like, you know, like even a newsletter with a comment section, you could call that a third space. So it's, I guess it's more of an exceptional kind of thought process.  But I might get back to the questions because I feel like we could talk about this for an hour.",

So, we did that in partnership with your and three people just presented sound work.  So there is often a presentation-y type format, but we, and I think that's because when people see a screen, they take a PowerPoint and that sort of thing. We are certainly always encouraging it to be something other than that, and whether that's a screening or something like a workshop interactive, like I'm actually presenting it now next month, and it'll hopefully be a workshop discussion rather than a presentation.  So I haven't really worked that yet. But you know what I mean? So we're certainly trying for it to be more open. But of course, when people are pressed for time, one of the easier things to do is to say, here's the work. I'm thinking this about it. What do you think about it?
