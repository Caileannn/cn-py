Is it kind of like a structural thing you do? Yeah, that's really just a question.",

And we think  you know for it to be more interesting it would be much more interesting if that widened out beyond us into whole other sets of people doing whole other sets of things and while we really like that to happen the thing is everyone's really busy in the world you know this pressure like rent people can't afford to live for their work all this sort of stuff so uh  While people are always like, this is great, we'd really love to get involved, the practicalities are quite difficult. And we also haven't always been graded because we are ourselves quite busy. And we tried to institute the structure where we'd meet once a week, or sorry, we'd meet the following week after an event. And especially recently, we've just been kind of up the walls. And so we haven't always managed to do that. And when you  I've been involved in a number of organizations, and I think it's really important to have quite clear structures because it allows people to get involved. And as we said at the start, we don't really have them because we haven't quite. So it's kind of on us to maybe also find ways to make it more open to other people to get involved. But that also is a big job, and it takes a lot of labor to set up those systems. And also, the risk, because you don't know if you do them, but anyone wants to be involved anyway. So it's a funny one. I don't know.",

It's like, you don't have the one person actually engaging and caring about what you do. And I think that's the really nice thing to see. Like, you know, community is really the most important thing. And I think it seems to be quite at the heart of it as well.  I might throw in another question here, because it might be a little bit related to what you've just said as well. How have you found, if at all, that the landscape of digital art and technology have changed over, I would say, over the course of data? But I mean, like, you know, maybe everyone's obviously got a different time frame here. But if you have noticed a difference, and especially these people coming back and in, like, what would you kind of feel that has changed most, really?  I can throw it over to Tom and Ash.",

But it's really at a kind of a input output level. You know, I know that's in the nature of AI a little bit, but it's a bit of a black box and it's much harder. A lot of technologies nowadays, well, they're not really based so much around, say, algorithms, they're much more based on things like data. And that's not something, if you open source it, that you can actually reproduce. So as an artist, you can't necessarily reproduce a training set.  So I think there, I think there's something in technology over the last 20 years that specifically, I guess, with kind of technology in terms of like digital code-based technology, it's where they've become a bit less accessible. And I think that's also led to like, I think a lot about social media, which social media art, there was a certain amount of it, maybe kind of, you know, 10 years ago might've been at the peak of it or a little bit more recently than that.  And now I teach in a college and very few of my students make work by social media, even though it's probably one of the biggest shaping forces in their life. And I think that's really kind of interesting that it's become almost invisible in a way.",

And I don't, and I also don't mean this as a criticism of the students. It's more about the technology and it's, it's kind of disappearance, you know? And I think, I mean, maybe, you know, because people talk about infrastructure that, um,  so an infrastructure is only something you know notice when it breaks and maybe things like social media have become infrastructural so that we don't see them anymore but I also think that that's a really interesting thing about technology and it really makes me dangerous. I know Paul will probably come on in just a minute because  there's a whole pile of artwork that's actually, its focus is making infrastructure visible because actually it's a really shaping force in our lives and whether that's like Paul's working on infrastructures, but obviously there's, you know, whole histories of like in STS and stuff like that, looking at the unequal provision of services and services shape our possibilities and so on. So I don't know, that's one thing I think for sure that's happened. I also think as technology has really like  up in terms of its capacity there became of course a focus on things like what you might call like finish so everything's like 4k now 8k you know and we're hopefully doing an event actually with this festival in canada and ireland called the small file media festival that kind of questions that idea of like more more more and i think that's something that's also  it used to be the case that people were really like, you could only make a video that was like this many pixels. So you always went to as big as you could be, but now the technology is so capable, but also we've realized the kind of environmental cost of that are, I mean, other material costs of that. So people are beginning to say, oh yeah, maybe this kind of limitless horizon idea is no longer valid.",

And as kind of Tom alluded to, you know, there was a lot more kind of  a lot more good vibes about technology, you know, but we've had like, to be real, like we've had Edward Snowden's revelations, although not too much has changed and so on. So the honeymoon period has worn off. You can even see that, like in relation to Ireland over the last few years, you know, you kind of have this dominant Silicon Docks narrative. Now there's kind of greater kind of criticality, more accessible to the public. We're seeing it specifically in language, like around data centers.  Obviously, corporate tax rate, you know, we had it with Apple and so on and so forth, and it's changing and they're just hot off the presses. And on the subject of infrastructure, I was down in Grand Canal Dock last night with a group and Meta have actually, they've gone.  Weird, they're not in offices anymore. They've gone somewhere else, like, but they're no longer in Grand Canal Dock. So, you know, shit's changed. Excuse my language, but language is all right. Things are changing. And obviously, you know, artwork is changing to reflect that, I would guess. Maybe Tom and Ashley, I'm not, I'm in academia, but not really kind of student focused so much at the moment. Although, you know, obviously, you know, we saw the last,  event like Aoife's work, you know, on social media, on Twitter and so on. So, yeah, sorry, I'm kind of rambling on here. Yeah, perfect.",

Like, you know, I think we were saying it last year around the 28th anniversary, like if Deja does go back asleep,  like that's fine, you know, there's no shame in that or whatever, like something else comes along, that's great. One thing I did when I was looking at that question, and this is maybe not someone's data, I think it's just like, oh, my own little wish list.  I'd love to see, like I have a dream that there will be like a physical place, studio, gallery for this kind of work, an independent one.  don't need a shitload of funding from pick your big tech company want to get in on the action something small so you know i'm not talking about dublin it could be limerick it could be mayo i don't care it would just be great to see it happen somewhere for people to go but somewhere for people internationally to go  like the agencies and stuff. So I think you, there's another, and I'm going to, sorry, I'm going off on one here. I know there was another question about inspiration and other organizations. So looking, and obviously there's, as I said at the beginning, there's lots of brilliant stuff going on here as well. Oh shit. Has everyone just turned their camera off?  No, we're all still here, don't worry. I was like, oh man, they don't like what I'm saying. Like, there's places like Fergus Field in London, there's like N\u00eemes in Cyprus and Limassol, obviously bigger, kind of slightly bigger ones like Transmedia, like, well, that's a festival as such, but, you know, like the influencers in Barcelona, like, I think that's kind of dormant now. Like, there's all of these other great spaces.  and events in Europe that are very much, you know, kind of community orientated, if I could say that. So we have that, you have that, not just somewhere data, but you guys think that everyone else is doing really great stuff, but it would be just nice to have a  Hey, that's, oh, I'm coming up to here. Well, okay. Obviously we're all going to go and meet here and, you know, be nice. Hey, look, I'm pitching to the choir, maybe here, a gallery studio space for people working in media, digital media, arts, et cetera, et cetera.",
