But yeah, I mean from us, concept novel was kind of a limerick thing. So I guess through that we were kind of, yeah, bound through that. Oh, Ash is here. Woo! Maybe this is a silly question and I should know the answer already because I've been here a bit more, but are you all artists? Mostly artists, trying to be. Attempting it anyway, like, you know, giving it his best shot. Yeah, great. Yeah, I think this is one of the, this is actually one of the problems, um,  with the, this is kind of one of the reasons we did the Constant Metal Newsletter, because we had such an annoyance with not really sometimes knowing ourselves what we were, like, and having this problem of, like, you know, definition, and especially externally as well, towards sometimes other people. I've been, like, like, even a project I was doing there, I was, like, working with Fidgetfee in, like, an aerial dance center, and they brought me in, and they're, like, literally the first I joined the meeting, and they were all dancers and aerialists, and they're, and then, like, they're, like, oh, we have,  Ger here, our lighting designer, is going to help us with the lights. And we have Walter. And Walter does, what do you do, Walter? And I was like, I don't know. Lazy. Depends on who's asking. It depends on what you want from me. So after two weeks of R&D, we still didn't know what I really did. But I did something, so it was fine. I don't know if that's the imposter syndrome sometimes coming through.

It'd probably be like, I don't know, we haven't figured out yet, might be part of the news editor, might be its own publishing thing, if it's very long and has lots of interesting points, because I don't want to cut out too much as well. Because yeah, honestly, like we, like just a little bit backstory of also like,  We started this newsletter thing. Constable L has been kind of doing its own thing for a while. Between me, Scott, and Roisin, we've been just trying to do new media, audiovisual events. They were quite hard to do, so they were quite spaced out in time. And after the last one, it was just such a big endeavor that we were like, we're going to pack this for a good long while, because we just need to get some space.  It was amazing, it was great fun, but like just the logistic hurdles of like being both the curator and the technical manager and the events provider and space provider and all that stuff, it was just crazy. So we practiced for a while and then me and Kayleigh got talking  I don't actually know what we're talking about. I think we were just kind of having a Zoom chat, and we were talking about basically that Denise McDonough from Culture Works, who was basically doing some stuff for the Arts Council, helping them devise the digital strategy. I don't know if you guys have seen that thing, but the digital strategy came out. This was like before, it was while it was still in kind of its last process of being worked on.  and we were kind of at that time getting quite frustrated with the discipline side of things where we didn't really quite know how to label us and also like we felt like that in the Arts Council process it's hard to kind of say oh I'm a visual artist well that's not quite descriptive of what you're actually doing so  Big old grievances there, we've written about it anyway. But basically, we were kind of thinking like, I was saying this to Kayleen that we had thought about like, you know, how to remedy this. One of the things was a newsletter. And then we were kind of thinking like, well, maybe there's someone in Ireland that has done this before. And then Kayleen had mentioned you guys dated. I was like, I actually had never heard of you, which I felt like a really bad disgrace because you guys have been around for so long.  I was like, yeah, we tried to suss out, do you guys cover this newsletter side? We didn't really have a newsletter, so that's why we went off and did this. But that's the start of seeing your stuff. And I was like, fuck, this is really odd. I feel bad for not having known this sooner. So that's why I was like, you know what? Maybe a chat and getting to meet you guys was the best way to do this.",

So as you were saying, like you're a Dublin century, but you're not anti anything outside of Dublin. It's just sometimes having a scope like what you are doing and having that clear is also quite handy because that's also some of the cause of knowledge. Like now it's like, okay, we're writing. We didn't actually know how to tackle this problem of like new media art not being in Ireland until I think between us, we're like, oh, a newsletter.  just write a newsletter, put open calls in it. It's not the best thing in the world, but it's a start. It's very simple, it's quite concise. And it's a start to something more than like, you know, and you can see where it comes from. So I think, I think rather than sitting around sometimes and pontificating about what you could do, maybe this, maybe that, like, you know, it's better just to do something like, you know, and get to meet cool people, like, you know, along the way. And that's kind of how it all kind of grows, you know? Sure.",

But there is a question actually about basically, how do you organize data events? Like, do you have a process behind it? Has there always been this kind of rubric where you're like, this is all we ever do? Or is it kind of very, just DIY? So yeah,  Maybe I can, I don't know, Paul, do you want to? No, no, Tom, that's on you. One thing that I think is worth saying at the start, because I did look at the questions a little bit, or a few of them, is, and you used the word, like, collective a lot, you know, which would be kind of a reasonable. I did not praise that one, yeah. But I suppose it's worth saying that, like, data is, it's just, it's been a lot of things over the years, and it's kind of really a very loose association of people who have an interest in art about, with technology.  And it's been running for over 20 years and different people at different times have done kind of more or less of the labor of that. So that like people like Jonah Booker-Cohen, Nikki Gogan, Ben Doolan, Rachel Dwyer, Tim Redfern. At the moment, Ashley and Paul and I are the people who kind of do most of that labor. Only, I suppose, just because it's kind of, you know, the hand is spinning and it's landing on us at the moment.  it is quite a loose thing and it's changed a lot in its form. And so we don't really have, I mean, to some extent, we don't really have codified ways of working. What we do have and what is collective is an interest in art about technology. And so we're quite, I wouldn't say it's totally ad hoc in the way we organize things at all. Like we, there's some consistency where we're doing them at the moment. Every month we have a structure, we have certain rules about trying to  I suppose, represent things in a certain way. But we really don't have a very organized and kind of set identity because we ultimately don't, well, I don't know, maybe this is where the other guys might come in on this, but we don't really want to be like the owners of data. We just happen to be the people at the moment who are booking the venues. And we constantly are  talking at events about like, well, who wants to propose a thing or who wants to do a thing? Sometimes people have no time for doing that. Other times they do and they suggest something or someone says, I'd like to present. And so we have people either coming to us saying, oh, I was at the data event or I heard about it. I'd like to do something. And equally, we spend our time sometimes thinking about it. But it is very fluid, I guess is worth saying.",

But really, most of the labor of data is people who are willing to talk about and share their work in public. And that's really important. So actually, the labor that we do is like facilitation rather than organization. We facilitate that.  people come, they decide how they want to present their work, they decide, you know, really what they want to present, and we kind of hand that over to them. So actually, it's kind of incorrect of me to say that we're the labourers landing on us, because actually, that's not true. Fair. So would you say that's kind of your recipe for how it's been running so long, this kind of like, no plan is the best plan, you know, working on just going from event to event and kind of having it as a collect, like, sorry, collective is the wrong word, but a communal  like ground for people to share work like more of a platform rather than as you said you don't deliver the content of data there is no content outside of what people bring like you know would you say that that is the kind of recipe for how it's been running for so long or is there maybe something beneath it all that again.",

I think there's also something about that that's interesting is that at the time when that data started and it came after some other things as well, like media house and that  that was quite an early time in what you might call new media art or, you know, technologies were much more open and open to both. And there was quite a crossover between people, artists in particular, and maybe people working with technology at a, at a, like making it level, you know, so it was a real crossover there. And you had people working in various kind of tech, like it was before even the term kind of tech was knocking around to the same extent. So there was a, I think there was a different social alliance there, you know,  And now I think we exist at a time which, you know, we have, I suppose, what is called big tech, maybe, you know, we've got a lot of platforms that shape a huge aspect of our life. They tend to be closed platforms. The role of a kind of media artist is very changed in that context. So in Dublin, for example, we have the headquarters of, you know, Google, Facebook, all these companies. We have a huge amount of the economy of Ireland is driven by these things, but we don't have a strong technology critical, um,  context, like a really strong one in the sense of like, for example, the universities, there's no, you know, like courses in like technology and society. There's no, you know, of course, there's lots of individual work and academics doing really great stuff. And so I'm not suggesting I'm an artist doing really great stuff around it.",

And I think because the project is so closed, it's harder for there to be a kind of a bedrock of people who are cracking it open. Certainly for me, one of the interests is trying to reproduce a community, not reproduce a particular community, but produce the context in which a community of technology-critical people can make work.  I think in the past, you know, there's been loads of really good work that was funded by tech companies. And that was because it was in a different context now. But at the moment, we're a little bit, we'd be wary, let's say, of that and of being kind of connected with that in some way. Certainly I would. I imagine the others as well.

Usually these spaces are, again, public and low cost barrier. So it should be free to go there or almost free to go there, very cheap.  And these spaces, he says, are like, or they kind of say, is basically a place where ideas of society can flow. A barrister might meet a worker, like, you know, or, you know, artists will talk to politicians. It's a place, and there's no, there is law, there's order, but there's no classes. So in these, in these spaces, people can talk freely and be, are open to criticism and be criticized. And there's no one there to basically censor anyone.  And I think this is something that kind of lacks in Ireland a little bit. I think the pub was the closest we ever get to a third space. And I think that's why pubs are so important in Ireland, because they have this, you know, yeah, the stratification of society, I guess, turns sideways a little bit at least. But I think that's something I definitely would love to see in Ireland, as you were saying, like having a space where big data companies and people who work in these data companies might be in contact with artists and academics and  a space where people can talk freely about these things without maybe criticism.",

People are chatting about actually very interesting, sometimes tech related, sometimes not, sometimes art related, sometimes not, but I find it's very interesting to kind of get people in a space and have people present ideas and new ways of thinking, but then to kind of  I think it's a very important part for the events to hold that space for a little while longer and allow the conversation to happen. Because I think for the speakers as well, because everything is done free and we don't get paid and we don't charge and the speakers don't get paid, it's important that they get  something out of it themselves. And I think that's why there's so much freedom in terms of like what they can present. It's always just like what is most helpful for them.

Just to kind of piggyback on that, just a question of support and obviously money and people aren't getting paid and kind of Tom touched on the context of labour. I think that's something that we do our best to try and kind of facilitate this platform. Let's just really just kind of general like  emails like come along, this is informal, don't stress, you know, we're all BSV, you know, you don't have to spend loads of time on this, we'll take whatever you have, and, you know, supportive, critical, like if needs be in it, but in a kind of like, you know,  I don't know what the word, like critical but sound.

What we're saying, though, is, you know, so this idea of like a third space or like a public sphere in which this kind of conversation can happen is, of course, this ideal that we would really love to have. But I think it actually touched on earlier on about us moving around the city. I think we're also aware that actually spaces aren't  neutral at all. And so the pub is a space for some people that they're quite happy to have a chat in. We had a couple of events in NCAD because they were provided with a space, which was great, but obviously an institution that a lot of people aren't comfortable with. And I mean, if you look at, say, the institution of technology and technology-based art, historically, it has a very, you know, like non-diverse bunch of people working in it. And the art as an institution itself is also like that. So quite aware of  I suppose one, the failings of art, our own failings of running data, not that it's on us specifically to address that on our own, but that, you know,  Like, it's very hard to have events. One, that someone will give you a space for free that has a projector, has a thing. It's very hard to find spaces that will reach beyond those kind of limitations. And arguably, there is no space that isn't limited in some way in terms of access to certain people or certain groups. And so I think it's really great. This third space idea is, I mean, it is a really great idea. And this idea of like a free public sphere is, I think, in the world at the moment, like a really important thing.  But it's something that unfortunately, I think we will never really get to either. I think it's more of an ideological thinking of like how you can think of how they thought of spaces, how you can divide up and categorize certain spaces kind of like, you know, when they're purposing. And I think there's a lot of conversation and books written about third space being online and how open forums and the new third space is realistically like, you know, so.  Even doing this, like, you know, this could be seen or like, you know, like even a newsletter with a comment section, you could call that a third space. So it's, I guess it's more of an exceptional kind of thought process.  But I might get back to the questions because I feel like we could talk about this for an hour.",

    "text": "Kind of somewhere similar. Maybe I think 2009 was the first one I was involved in. Yeah. Or it could be 2008, I'm not sure. But yeah, I mean, just to kind of reiterate what Paul said, there were, and at one point also again, there was funding maybe as part of it to organize and pay people to do workshops.  there's been a really big, I mean one thing that like it did start in the pub, going back to what Ashley was saying, it started in the pub and it was like an open projector, that was the kind of format that it started with, so not quite but just like screen based and so that's something that's new, the last one was a student open projector, so it was for undergraduate students in colleges around the country, I mean it was mostly Dublin based but actually a Limerick student or artist as well and  So that's something we still do is open projectors as Ashley also mentioned earlier on, we did one that was just fine by so no screens and I think that was probably the only data ever that didn't have a screen. So, we did that in partnership with your and three people just presented sound work.  So there is often a presentation-y type format, but we, and I think that's because when people see a screen, they take a PowerPoint and that sort of thing. We are certainly always encouraging it to be something other than that, and whether that's a screening or something like a workshop interactive, like I'm actually presenting it now next month, and it'll hopefully be a workshop discussion rather than a presentation.  So I haven't really worked that yet. But you know what I mean? So we're certainly trying for it to be more open. But of course, when people are pressed for time, one of the easier things to do is to say, here's the work. I'm thinking this about it. What do you think about it? And it's a really good, like, there's a reason presentations exist. They're actually a way of communicating things, even if they aren't. Of course, yeah. Yeah, you know, so.",

    "text": "Just to finish, Aisling, no, I was going to throw it over to you, Aisling. No, go ahead.  I was just going to say, obviously, I'm way more recent to it, but I do find that the format of allowing people do what they want kind of opens it up as well, because we're not saying you have to do a presentation. So even with the sound event that we did, someone did a live radio show and we had a live chat box going.  sometimes that openness when it's really just like let this be like the most beneficial thing for you possible like that should be your main thing for you to get something out of this it means that it it opens up the format to be  to be new things, which I think is really exciting. And it also allows the community of presenters and stuff actually have quite a strong influence in data and what it is and what the events are. So I think it's nice. And I think we enjoy allowing people kind of decide what they're comfortable with and having that. Yeah.  Yeah, exactly that. I don't know about you guys, but I've had to do presentations before and it can be stressful and it takes time. So it's just nice to go do what you want. We'll make it work and we'll work with you. Yeah. No problem.",
