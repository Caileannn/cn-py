They were quite hard to do, so they were quite spaced out in time. After the last one, it was just such a big endeavour that we decided we were going to park this for a good long while, because we just needed some space. It was amazing, it was great fun, but just the logistic hurdles of being both the curator, the technical manager, the events provider, space provider, and all that stuff, it was just crazy. So we parked it for a while, and then me and Cailean got talking, I don't actually know what we were talking about. I think we were just having a Zoom chat, and we were talking about different stuff, about the Arts Council, the digital strategy. This was while it was still in kind of its last process of being worked on and we were at that time getting quite frustrated with the discipline side of things, where we didn't quite know how to label ourselves, and we felt that in the application process it felt wrong to say 'oh I'm a visual artist' when really that's not quite descriptive of what you're actually doing. So basically, we were thinking on how to remedy this. One of the things came to mind was a newsletter. Cailean had mentioned you guys and I actually had never heard of you, which I felt kind of stupid because you have been around for so long. We were trying to suss out, do you guys cover this newsletter side? We really couldn't tell, so we went off and just did it. But yeah, that's the start of seeing your stuff. I was like, fuck, this is really odd. I feel bad for not having known sooner. So that's why we said, you know what? Maybe a chat to get to meet you guys was the best way about this.",

Now, we're writing a newsletter. We didn't actually know how to tackle the problem of new media art not being in showcased much in Ireland until I between us, we were like, oh, a newsletter. Just write a newsletter, put open calls in it. It's not the best thing in the world, but it's a start. It's very simple, and it's quite concise. It's a start to maybe something more, lets see where it goes.

And it's been running for over 20 years with different people at different times having done, more or less, the labour of that. So people like Jonah Booker-Cohen, Nicky Gogan, Ben Gaulon, Rachel O'Dwyer, Tim Redfern. At the moment, Aisling, Paul and I are the people who do most of that labour. So I suppose now, the hand is spinning and it's landing on us. It is quite a loose thing and it's changed a lot in its form. To some extent, we don't really have codified ways of working. What we do have and what is collective, is an interest in art about technology. Not totally, but we're quite ad hoc in the way we organize things. There is some consistency to what we're doing at the moment. Every month we have a structure, we have certain rules about trying to showcase and represent things in a certain way. But we really don't have a very organized and set identity because we ultimately don't want to be the owners of D.A.T.A. We just happen to be the people at the moment who are booking the venues. We constantly are asking at events 'who wants to propose a thing or who wants to do a thing?' Sometimes people have no time for doing that. Other times they do and they suggest something to present. So we have people either coming to us saying 'Oh I was at the D.A.T.A event or heard about it. I'd like to do something'. Equally, we spend some of our time thinking about it. It is very fluid, which is worth saying.",

So, the labour that we do is facilitation rather than organization. We facilitate, people come, and they decide how they want to present their work and what they want to present, and we hand that over to them. So actually, it's kind of incorrect of me to say that we're labourers because actually, that's not true.",

That was quite an early time in what you might call 'new media art' as around then, technologies were much more open, and open to both. There was a bit of a crossover between people, artists in particular, and people working with technology at a maker level. You had people working on various kinds of tech, it was before even the term 'tech' was knocking around to the same extent. So I feel there was a different social alliance there. Now, I think we exist at a time which is more governed by big tech. A lot of these platforms shape a huge aspect of our life and they tend to be closed platforms. The role of a media artist is very much changed in that context. So in Dublin, for example, we have the headquarters of Google, Facebook, Apple, and all these companies. A huge amount of the economy of Ireland is driven by these industries, but we don't have a strong technology critical context. At least, not a really strong one for example in universities, there's no courses in-depthly looking at technology and society. There's lots of individual work and academics doing really great stuff. I'm not suggesting I'm an artist doing really great stuff around it, but I find it odd given our stance globally.",

Certainly for me, one of the interests is trying to reproduce a community, not reproduce a particular community, but produce the context in which a community of technology-critical people can make work. I think in the past, there's been loads of really good work that was funded by tech companies. That was because it was in a different context. But at the moment, we'd be wary, of being connected with them in some way. Certainly I would. I imagine the others as well. So we want to make it as an outside space that doesn't think exists hugely in the city. Does that make sense?",

The idea goes that your first space is your home, your second space is your work, and the third space is a public space which everyone has access to. Usually these spaces are, again, public and have a low cost barrier. So it should be free to go there or almost free to go there, very cheap, so that no classes of society are left out. These spaces are a place where ideas of society can flow freely. I think this is something that is lacking in Ireland a little bit. The pub is as close as we ever get to a third space. I think that's why pubs are so important in Ireland. But I think that's something I definitely would love to see, as you were saying, having a space where big data companies and people who work in these data companies might be in contact with artists and academics - a space where people can discuss freely about these things.",

Because a lot of the time after the event we would just choose the closest pub and if anyone wants to join, they're welcome. There's actually usually quite a big take up on that which is lovely because there's these remnants of criticality and thought left in people from the event but then when they have the freedom of just being in the pub, people get chatting about very interesting stuff. Sometimes tech related, sometimes not, sometimes art related, sometimes not, but I find it's very interesting to get people in a space and have people present ideas and new ways of thinking, but then to hold that space open for a little while longer after the event and allow the conversation to happen. I think for the speakers as well, because everything is for free and we don't get paid and we don't charge and the speakers don't get paid, it's important that they get something out of it themselves. That's why there's so much freedom in terms of what they can present. It's always what is most helpful for them. But I think the discussion is where the richness is.",

The pub for some people is a space that they're quite happy to have a chat in, others not. We had a couple of events in NCAD because they provided us with a space, which was great, but obviously it's an institution that a lot of people aren't comfortable with. Same with the institution of technology and technology-based art, historically, it has a very non-diverse bunch of people working in it. Art as an institution is the same. So we are quite aware of the failings of art, our own failings of running D.A.T.A, not that it's specifically on us to address that on our own, but it does make it hard to run events. For someone willing to give you a space for free that has a projector, is one thing. Another is it's very hard to find spaces that will reach beyond those limitations. Arguably, there is no space that isn't limited in some way in terms of access to certain people or certain groups. So I think the third space is a good idea and ideology but it's something that unfortunately, is hard to implement.",

As mentioned earlier, we've done one with just sound presentations so I guess there is often a presentation-y type format, and I think that's daunting to people sometimes so we certainly always encourage it to be something other than that, and whether that's a screening or something like an interactive workshop, like I'm hopefully doing a workshop discussion thing at the next rather than just a presentation.

So even now, we're making work around things like AI, but it's really at a kind of a input output level. I know that's in the nature of AI a little bit, but it's a bit of a black box and it's much harder. A lot of technologies nowadays, they're not really based so much around, say, algorithms, they're much more based on things like data. That's not something, if you open source it, that you can actually reproduce. So as an artist, you can't necessarily reproduce a training set. So I think there's something in technology over the last 20 years that specifically with technology in terms of digital code-based technology, it's where they've become a bit less accessible. I think a lot about social media, and social media art. 10 years ago might've been at the peak of it or a little bit more recently than that. Now I teach in a college and very few of my students make work by social media, even though it's probably one of the biggest shaping forces in their life.

It's more about the technology and it's disappearance. I think because people talk about infrastructure, as in infrastructure is only something you know notice when it breaks and maybe things such as social media have become infrastructural, so that we don't see them anymore. I also think that that's a really interesting thing about technology and it really makes it dangerous. I know Paul will probably come on in just a minute because there's a whole pile of artwork where its focus is making infrastructure visible as it's a shaping force in our lives, and whether that's like Paul who works on infrastructure; but obviously there's the whole histories of STS; looking at the unequal provision of services and services which shape our possibilities and so on. So, that's one thing I think for sure that's happened. I also think as technology has grown in terms of its capacity there became of course a focus on things like 4k, and now 8k. We're hopefully doing an event with this festival in Canada and Ireland called the Small File Media festival, which questions that idea of like more, more, more. I think that's something that also used to be the case, where people could only make a video that was like this many pixels. So you always went to as big as you could be, but now the technology is so capable, but also we've realized the kind of environmental cost, and the material costs of that.

So the honeymoon period has worn off. You can even see that in relation to Ireland over the last few years, you kind of have this dominant Silicon Docks narrative. Now there's greater criticality, which is more accessible to the public. We're seeing it specifically in language, like around data centers, obviously corporate tax rate, you know, we had it with Apple and so on and so forth, and it's changing. On the subject of infrastructure, I was down in Grand Canal Dock last night and Meta have gone.  It's weird, they're not in offices anymore, they're no longer in Grand Canal Dock.

We were saying it last year around the 20th anniversary, if D.A.T.A does go back asleep, that's fine, there's no shame in that, something else might come along. One thing I did when I was looking at that question, and this is my own little wish list - I have a dream that there will be an independent physical place/studio/gallery for this kind of work, an independent one. One that would get a shitload of funding from - pick your big tech company - that want to get in on the action. Something small and grassroots. I'm not talking about Dublin, it could be Limerick it could be Mayo, I don't care. It would just be great to see it happen somewhere for people to go but somewhere for people internationally to for residencies and stuff. I know there was a question about inspiration and other organisations. As I said at the beginning, there's lots of brilliant stuff going on here as well. But there's places like Furtherfield in London, there's like NeMe in Limassol, Cyprus, Obviously slightly bigger ones like Transmediale, well, that's a festival as such. But, there are all of these other great spaces and events in Europe that are very much community orientated, if I could say that. So we have that, you have that, not just D.A.T.A, but you guys and everyone else is doing really great stuff, but it would be just nice to have a gallery/studio space.",

Maybe not the right words, but how to actually tie people together who are all doing the same thing. Especially in the time of the internet when it's seemingly so easy, but sometimes it can be so easy to also be disconnected with things.",

We're not really sure where we're going with it yet, but we can tease it out, because what I'm going to be talking about is this idea for a listing website. And basically, it's kind of similar, right? I want to do a workshop about how a decentralized listing site could work. So it would good to have some you there for the after discussions.",

I don't know if that's the same idea of decentralization, but its an events page and their tickets were basically put on a blockchain so that you couldn't tout tickets. Not exactly the same thing, but it was definitely the same vein of trying to get away from social media events. You know, Facebook events was the biggest thing for Facebook. It was the handiest thing ever! So easy to make an event and invite people. That's the one thing I still mourn with Facebook gone.",
